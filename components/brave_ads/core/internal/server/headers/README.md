# Url Request Headers

URL request headers are a set of key-value pairs sent to a server as part of an
HTTP request. They provide additional information about the request, such as the
type of content being requested, the format in which the response should be
returned, and any required authentication or authorization credentials. URL
request headers are included in the HTTP request message header and are used by
servers to determine how to process the request and to return an appropriate
response.
